### ABOUT ME
For 10 years of work in an NGO, I went from a volunteer to a member of the Board. I have experience in working with various projects (leadership, coordination, project planning, reporting).

At the same time, I was engaged in SMM and I led several projects.

After the events of 2020, I moved to Warsaw and decided to devote myself entirely to front-end development.
